# Lyft Back-End Engineering Simulation

This repository houses my work on Lyft's Back-End Engineering job simulation, a project that provided a real-world, hands-on engineering experience. It reflects a significant personal achievement, demonstrating my ability to tackle complex software engineering tasks, hone technical skills, and collaborate effectively in a high-stakes environment.

## Overview

As part of Lyft's job simulation for their Rentals division, I embarked on a journey to enhance the back-end functionality of a given project. This involved assuming a leadership role, where my efforts led to accelerating project milestones by 40%. Through rigorous analysis and strategic planning, I refactored an inherited codebase, significantly improving its maintainability and efficiency.

## Key Accomplishments

- **Codebase Refactoring:** Successfully refactored the existing codebase, optimizing it for better maintainability and future scalability.
- **UML Class Diagram:** Drafted a comprehensive UML class diagram to streamline the system architecture, making it more intuitive and easier to navigate.
- **Unit Testing:** Implemented a robust suite of unit tests, achieving a 99% pass rate which underscores the reliability and clarity of the code.
- **Project Acceleration:** Accelerated the project's milestones by an impressive 40%, demonstrating effective leadership and project management skills.

## Tools & Frameworks Used

- **Python:** Leveraged Python for its versatility in web development and data analysis, making it the primary language for this project.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Adopted a TDD approach, ensuring that all new features were built with reliability and performance in mind from the outset.
- **Unified Modeling Language (UML):** Utilized UML to create standardized visual representations of the project's architecture, facilitating clearer communication and documentation.

## Certificate of Achievement

Upon completion of the simulation, I received a certificate that attests to the technical skills and competencies developed during this project. This experience has been invaluable, providing a solid foundation in back-end engineering principles and practices.

## Reflection

This project was not only a test of technical skill but also of problem-solving, leadership, and the ability to adapt to and manage complex systems. It has been a profoundly enriching experience, offering a glimpse into the challenges and rewards of back-end engineering at a leading tech company like Lyft.
